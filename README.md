# Weather Application

This project is a web-based weather application built with Flask and JavaScript, providing real-time weather data for a selected city or the user's current location. The application fetches data from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and displays current, yesterday's, and tomorrow's weather conditions.

## Features

- **City Search**: Users can input a city name to get weather information.
- **Current Location**: Uses geolocation to fetch weather data for the user's current location.
- **Temperature Toggle**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Bootstrap for a responsive, user-friendly interface.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Frontend structure, styling, and layout, including form input, buttons, and result display container.
- **main.py**: Flask application backend that serves the frontend HTML file.
- **script.js**: JavaScript code for fetching and displaying weather data, as well as unit toggle functionality.
